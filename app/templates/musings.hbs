        <h4>Chance vs. choice</h4>
        <p>
          There's so many distractions in our every
          day lives - so many paths one could
          go down. How do you choose? You
          have to commit, I suppose. Just
          pick.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how do you know if it's the right thing
          to do? Well, you don't. And therein
          lies the problem - the paradox
          of choice. The decision to stay.
          Or to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision to reach out, or stay silent.
        </p>

        <h4>No one else</h4>
        <p>
          It is me who needs myself the most and me
          who I can turn to count on and
          look for deep and inner healing.
